# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:

            # /dev.sqlite3 /test.sqlite3 /production.postgresql

production:
  <<: *default

# changed the default database / 
# the code from Gemfile are below::


#group :production do

 #  gem 'pg'
   #gem 'rails_12factor' #this seems like it was commented out...
 #end
 
# group :development do
